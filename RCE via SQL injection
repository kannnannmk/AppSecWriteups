This finding is not related with any bug bounty programs, but I have found it at my work using burp suite and SQLMAP

   Below steps I have used for exploiting the SQL Injection to get the shell access by using SQLMAP
             
1.	 I have used this payload list to brute force the parameters using burp suite, after getting few responses that contain the SQL / Database error in responses, I have decided for exploitation SQLMAP for exploitation. 

       https://github.com/payloadbox/sql-injection-payload-list                

      

2.	Using sqlmap -h to get the list to available options and used the enumeration commands to retrieve few information from the databse
                            
3.	Exploit it further? This a POST request, I have copied it and saved in a file and used the below SQLMAP command to can execute it

4.	I have used sqlmap -r request_file.txt -p Email  –passwords option to get passwords but retrieved passwords are found empty

5.	 sqlmap -r request_file.txt -p Email --dump-all to get all database table entries or we add –tables or –columns to get specific information

6.	Few user details are retrieved from the table                                                   

7.	 Then I have used the –os-shell command to exploit it further
                                 

8.	Stored procedure xp_cmdshell is found enabled, so that SQLMAP used this to get the windows shell access 
       

9.	Finally got the access to the shell and executed the direct windows commands.
